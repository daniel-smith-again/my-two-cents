       Programming languages have come a long way since they first made the 
transition from a formal theory to a practical skill. There's been many 
advancements, most of which have been necessitated by the existence of Lisp. 
But things have changed drastically since the invention of Lisp. We have the 
personal computer, the smartphone, massively distributed systems, homogeneous
computer architecture, multiple concurrent processing units in a single system,
and almost everything has a screen attached. Our use cases and requirements for
a general purpose, "system programming language" have changed.

       Much of the discourse around programming languages is what they do do, 
or the wishy-washy user experience ergonomics of a language and its tooling.
I find "friction" to be a deeply uninteresting topic. I would never talk about 
a runny nose when I could talk about the malady causing it instead. So below, 
you'll find a list of the current "maladies" which plague programming languages
and their tooling.

Compilers that need the internet.

Inability to deal with executable formats.

IEEE 754 Floating Point or nothing.

"Checkers"
