       The movie American Beauty was originally released to universal critical 
acclaim, but has since fallen out of favor. The presiding sentiment is
"Sure, it's good, but don't believe the hype". Multiple factors led to the 
changing sentiment, but largely the culprit was that modern cynnicism is much 
more potent than anything 90's counterculture could dream of. More modern takes 
on American Beauty consist of 
     "Aww, poor rich white dude gets bored of all his cis white privilege",     
  "Career women don't actually act like that. Who wrote this sexist baloney?",  
                                      and                                      
         "What the heck is the deal with that video of a plastic bag?"          
Simply put, American Beauty is out of touch because the main facets of the 
culture and economy it portrays are now considered luxury. There's no grounding
in real life anymore for the modern viewer to identify with, so all the preachy,
hokey, fart-sniffy parts stick out like a sore thumb. The abstractness doesn't
help either. This is not your average Netflix one-hour special, lab tested for
"passive viewing" on portrait layout. Now, it's hip to hate on American Beauty.
But so what if American Beauty is a faded still-life of a better world that 
all the characters ironically hate living in? Does it still hold up?


                              What's It All About?                              

       What's the message of American Beauty? I say it's regret. Usually the
interpretations are about highfalutin crap like beauty or sexuality. Well,
I'm not like other girls, so I say it's about regret. Trust me. The Burnhams are
all grown up, but they aren't where they thought they'd be in life, and they 
certainly aren't where they wanted to be. It's clear the Fitts haven't stopped 
regretting everything since their marriage. Jane is wasting her high school 
years, and Ricky has decided that his personality is "having a video camera". 
There's lots to regret there. 

       On a tangent, nobody seems to point out the actual purpose of the gay 
couple isn't to reveal Frank's homophobia, it's to show his regret. The only two
truly happy people in the movie are the two gay dudes, showing Frank what he 
could have had if he didn't spend his life running away from himself.

       If you're still shakey on the whole regret thing, look at the climactic 
scene where Lester comes to his senses (the most artistic way to describe that)
and sits down at the kitchen table nostalgia tripping over a photo of everyone
when they were younger and happy. Regret. Then he finally finds his way out of 
his midlife crisis by fucking dying! Regret.

       Carolyn is about to finish off her husband for... not liking 
Frank Sinatra? Your guess is as good as mine here. But anyway, she comes home to 
find out Frank did her a favor, which took all the fun out of the idea. Regret.

       Frank's wife has regret too... well, just look at her.

       You get the idea. It's about regret. You didn't see enough tits in 
high school before your testosterone fizzled out. You didn't get rich selling 
properties you don't own. Your acne didn't go away after 8th grade. You spend 
all that fucking money on a camcorder and still nobody talks to you. You 
married a closeted gay man. You lived your life in the closet. You worked in a 
job you hate and never got your brand new Firebird. You and your partner 
finally found a quiet neighborhood and the man across the street gets shot by 
his neighbor. It's about regret and regret is pretty darn relevant today, 
just as it was thirty years ago.


                             The Critics are Wrong                             

       Nobody's been able to decide what the actual theme of American Beauty is.
The critics all agree that there is no specific theme, it's a satire. At first, 
that made it a good movie. Now, being a satire makes it a bad movie because 
the middle class is dying and who wants to watch satire of something you 
desperately want in your life? I'm writing this article in an apartment. Getting
murdered in my own home means I'd own a home. Sign me up! 

       The surprise message at the tail end of the movie, "the world is big, and
you and your problems are so, so small" is a very 90's message. The world is now
small and all your private greivances are huge and public on your social media 
from all the thirty-second clips you post of yourself crying. Welcome to the 
2020's, show us your feet. There's lots of critical interpretations that 
mistakenly highlight this as the main theme. Life is beautiful, or finding 
beauty in unexpected places.

It's easy to dismiss American Beauty as some pseudo-intellectual hot takes about 
life in general. It's percieved as vague or abstract because the actual theme 
is only ever implied. You're supposed to find regret, not hear the characters 
talking about it. The entire fact that Lester is having a midlife crisis is a 
red herring, theme-wise. It's the symptom, not the cause.

Despite the criticisms about sexist portrayals in the movie, it's very real that
the two ladies in the Burnham family manage their insecurity by putting Lester 
down. (Everybody inexplicably wants to kill Lester in this movie. I guess he 
just has a killable face?).
